# Overview
This image creates a Docker container that generates a conda environment which can be used with the R package `spacyr`.

It is based on the `continuumio/miniconda3` image and activates an environment called `spacy_condaenv` with Python 3.6 and spaCy as well as the latest Englisch and German language models installed.

# Usage
You can use the container to run `spacyr` in RStudio (Server) or Shiny Server. Mount a volume or local directory to `/opt/conda` at runtime or in your `docker-compose.yml`. Within your R script use
```
spacy_initialize(python_executable = "/opt/conda/envs/spacy_condaenv/bin/python")
```
(or change `/opt/conda` your local directory if you are developing outside of Docker).

You can find an exemplary docker-compose file at [vallivh/info-app](https://github.com/vallivh/info-app/blob/master/docker-compose.yml).
